This is a brief sc tutorial, best run in a 24-line window.  
Type 'q' to exit, ^Z to suspend (w/ Job Control). 
^G interrupts a command.      

Cells are named by their column and row number.  For example,         
Cell A6   Cell B6   Cell C6   
Cell A7   
Cell A8             Cell C8   
Cells range from A0 to ZZ(some number depending on free memory).      
Cells can also be named by the user.  See 'range names' in the manual.
You can move the cursor a couple of different ways:         
          ^n, j and the <DOWN> arrow key go down  
          ^p, k and the <UP> arrow key go up      
          ^b, h and the <LEFT> arrow key go left  
          ^f, l and the <RIGHT> arrow key go right
          You can go directly to a cell by typing 'g' and the cell name.        
          'g c6' will take you to cell c6.        
Cells can contain numbers, formulas, or text.     
Most of the cells on this page contain text.      
                    <Type 'g page2' to continue>                      

Cell d22 contains text        Text      
Cell d23 contains a number        123.34
Cell d24 contains a formula       211.34

To see what the cell contains, just move the cursor         
onto the cell.  The contents will show up on line 1 in the brackets.  

You can enter data into cells like this:
          '<text' enters left justified text.     
          '>text' enters right justified text.    
          '=number' enters a number     
          '=formula' enters a formula.  

Try duplicating d22 through d24 in e22 through e24.         

You erase a cell by typing 'x' with the cursor on the cell. 


                    <Type 'g page3' to continue>                      

Here is a typical use for numbers and formulas:   

     10.30   1877.50    234.70             2122.50
     44.56     44.30     -3.00               85.86
     88.74   8000.00     -9.00             8079.74
     99.20    -88.00    -44.60              -33.40

    242.80   9833.80    178.10            10254.70

The data is entered in a44 through c47. 
Cells a49, b49, and c49, sum their respective columns.      
Cells e44, e45, e46, and e47 sum their respective rows.     
Cell E49 is a grand total.    
Try changing some of the data cells and watch the sums change.        

You can also edit cells by putting the cursor on the cell and typing: 
          'e' to edit the numeric portion.        
          'E' to edit the string portion.         
                    <Type 'g page4' to continue>                      

Since you are reading this, you know that you can load      
a data base from a file by typing the file name as an       
argument to the program.  You can also load or save a       
data base using the file commands:      

          'G file'  Gets the data from an sc file.
          'P file'  Puts the data from the spreadsheet into a file.   

Try 'P foo.sc' to write this to the file foo.sc   
The Get command erases the current spreadsheet.   
To merge a spreadsheet with the one currently in  
the machine, use:   

          'M file'  Merge the data from a saved sc file.    

You can also get human readable versions of the data        
by using the Write command:   

                    <Type 'g page5' to continue>                      

Try 'W tut.txt' for a clear text version of the tutorial.   


This is the end of the tutorial.  We have explored
The basic commands.  Much more detail is available
in the man page.    

To quit this program, type 'q'.         

                              GOOD LUCK!
